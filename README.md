toy app but highlights many important concepts in JavaScript, HTML, CSS and DOM manipulation techniques.

## How to Run

Download or clone the project to your local machine. Then you can run the program by following either options below.

- Option 1: Drag and drop the index.html file inside the src folder to the web browser.
- Option 2: Install a web server via npm like bsync or http-server. Then run the server inside the src folder to serve
  index.html.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Some ideas for future improvements include:

- make different colored Pac Man
- rotate Pac Man to match velocity direction
- add Mrs. Pac Man
- add ghosts
